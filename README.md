#### Description:

The **Weather Forecast Application** is a modern web application that provides users with real-time weather information based on any city they enter. This project leverages the power of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch up-to-date weather data, displaying essential weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. It features an interactive user interface built with **Flask**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and includes dynamic error handling to ensure users have a smooth experience, even in the case of invalid input or network issues.

With a visually appealing and clean design, this app displays a background image of **Azadi Tower** in Tehran, creating a local connection for users in Iran or those interested in the iconic landmark.
